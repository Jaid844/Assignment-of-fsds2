    "A string is a data type in programming used to represent text or characters. It is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks, such as \"hello\" . Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created. On the other hand, a variable is a named storage location that can hold different types of values, including strings. Variables act as containers for data and allow for dynamic manipulation and referencing of values throughout a program. They provide flexibility in storing and working with various data during program execution."

    "1. Integer: The integer data type represents whole numbers without decimal points. Integers can be positive or negative. Examples of integers are -5, 0, and 10. In most programming languages, integer values have a fixed range determined by the number of bits used to store them. Operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on integers.\n",

    "2. Float/Double: The float (floating-point) or double data type is used to represent numbers with decimal points. Floating-point numbers are approximate representations of real numbers and can have fractional parts. Examples of floating-point numbers are 3.14, -0.5, and 1.0. Floating-point numbers are typically stored using a fixed number of bits and have limitations in terms of precision and range.\n",

Strings are typically enclosed in quotation marks, either single ('') or double (\"\"). Examples of strings are \"Hello, World!\", and \"12345\". String operations include concatenation (joining two or more strings), indexing (accessing individual characters in a string), and various string manipulation functions.\n",
